Team Schnapsidee Story
There once was a little German boy named Hanz who lived in Berlin.
Hanz had a serious addiction to bratwurst and brot sandwiches.
He would drive his Porsche up the Hauptstrasse to get bratwurst.
But Raesfeld was the game and he had to have it ALL!
His insatiable hunger led him to a doner restaurant in Raesfeld.
