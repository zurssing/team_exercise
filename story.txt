Team Schnapsidee Story
There once was a little German boy named Hanz who lived in Berlin.
Hanz had a serious addiction to bratwurst and brot sandwiches.
He would eat them often in the biergarten. 
He would drive his Porsche up the Hauptstrasse to get bratwurst.
But Raesfeld was the game and he had to have it ALL!
His insatiable hunger led him to a doner restaurant in Raesfeld.
He then followed his meal with gebaeck at the baecherei for dessert.
Then a Hund snatch his gebaeck.
After eating, he rocked out to Rammstein for a few hours by his lonely.
After a while, he took his hund out for a walk. 
While on this walk around Eltz, Hanz was positive he saw a Mehlhase!
